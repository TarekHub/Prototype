The purpose of pattern is to create new objects by duplicating existing objects called prototypes 
that have the ability to clone.

The prototyoe patern is used in the following field:

1/ A system of objects to create instances without knowing the hierarchy of classes describing.
2/ An object system must create dynamically loaded class instances.
3/ the object system must remain simple and not include a parallel class hierarchy.
